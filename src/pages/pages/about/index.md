Each experience offered me different opportunities and challenges, and during my time at these companies I've had the pleasure of:

* Designing, implementing, and deploying enterprise scale systems that handle thousands of requests per hour 👨‍💻
* Leading teams of other developers to accomplish short and long term goals 
* Building mobile applications and the backend systems that support them from the ground up 📱
* Mentoring fellow team members and producing documentation regarding best practices, development patterns, and business knowledge 👨‍🏫 📖
* Leveraging modern technologies such as Kubernetes, Openshift, and Jenkins to accelerate development and deployment times 🚀
* Working with business stakeholders and technical experts to establish business and technical requirements for applications 📝
