Hi! I'm a full stack developer with a passion for tinkering with new technologies and exploring the boundaries between software and art.

Most recently I've co-founded SymbolSpeak, a startup dedicated to creating software to give people a voice who would otherwise be unable to speak. More info on that soon! :)

## Clients
I've had the pleasure of working for many companies over the years in many different industries.

Each experience offered me different opportunities and challenges, and during my time at these companies I've had the pleasure of:

* Designing, implementing, and deploying enterprise scale systems that handle thousands of requests per hour 👨‍💻
* Leading teams of other developers to accomplish short and long term goals 
* Building mobile applications and the backend systems that support them from the ground up 📱
* Mentoring fellow team members and producing documentation regarding best practices, development patterns, and business knowledge 👨‍🏫 📖
* Leveraging modern technologies such as Kubernetes, Openshift, and Jenkins to accelerate development and deployment times 🚀
* Working with business stakeholders and technical experts to establish business and technical requirements for applications 📝
