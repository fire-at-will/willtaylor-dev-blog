Since I was a child, I've been fascinated with the way that computers work. I recall being enamored with the [communicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicator_(Star_Trek)) used in Star-Trek or dreaming over Dexter's secret laboratory from the [90's cartoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter%27s_Laboratory) of the same name.

As I entered my teens, my attention pivoted towards video games. While I raced around in Mario Kart 64, I couldn't help but wonder what was happening under the hood. I knew that computers were good at doing basic arithmetic, but *how* could simple arithmetic add up to create such vibrant worlds as those in the games I played?

*Video games like Mario Kart 64 made me wonder how applications work under the hood.*

I dreamed of the countless lines of code that must be working in unison to orchestrate such a complex world. How were the engineers able to conduct all of those moving parts to create such a symphony? I couldn't imagine how on Earth they managed to make it all work. I *did* know that one day I would have to find out.

Fast forward a few years and countless projects later and I've learned so much about what makes software tick. I've received a degree in computer science from TCU and have worked as a software engineer for many companies large and small, in tech and in other industries. I enjoy working in every corner of the stack - frontend to backend. My biggest passion these days is  writing iOS apps in Swift - they're such a delight to write! I'm also very interested in microservice architectures and their implementations. I tend to write them using Spring Boot with Java but I dabble in other languages and frameworks from time to time. My favorite part of software is where it intersects with art to create something that could not exist in any other medium - expect to see more from that soon!

It's my hope that this blog inspires and helps aspiring software engineers to pursue their passion.

I can't thank you enough for joining me on this adventure. Cheers! 

```java
// Or, as they say in Java...
System.out.println("Hello, world! üéâüçæüéä");
```
