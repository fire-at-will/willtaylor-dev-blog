Welcome to Taylor Made Tech Tips! I’m so excited to share all of the things that I’ve been learning in the world of programming. </p>\n<p>I’ve always been fascinated with the way computers work. As a child, I often wondered how games like Mario Kart 64 worked under the hood. I dreamed about the countless lines of code that worked together to create such a fun world and wondered just how on Earth the programmers managed to make it all work.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few years and countless projects later and I’ve learned so much about how the world of computers work. I’ve written games, websites, apps, shells, and now this blog that you’re reading! With the new year, I’ve decided to write this blog to share the things I’m learning so that it might help someone else out. Expect to see articles talking about all things related to Java, Swift, apps, microservices, and programming in general.</p>\n<p>The website is still very much under construction, so don’t be surprised if things change a bit over the upcoming days and months.</p>\n<p>I can’t thank you enough for joining me on this adventure. Cheers! </p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-java\">// Or, as they say in Java...\nSystem.out.println(\"Hello, world! 🎉🍾🎊\");\n</code></pre>","fields":{"tagSlugs":null},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello, World!","tags":null,"date":"2019-03-14T20:11:15+00:00","description":"Welcome to Will's dev blog!
